## Internal Transfer

Within the Findora Wallet, you can perform what we call Internal Transfer. This is essentially our mechanism for swapping your `Native FRA` assets to `EVM-Compatible FRA` assets. As powerful as `Native FRA` is, `EVM-compatible FRA` tokens is best suited for paying gas fees, dApp development and other transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. The Native and EVM-Compatible FRA types are tokens of the chain and swapping between them happens on a 1:1 basis using the `burn-mint` function.

### Swap from Native FRA to EVM-Compatible FRA Assets

First step is to click on the Internal Transfer section of the sidebar. In the Native Wallet section then place the address of the wallet into the EVM-compatible wallet field. The amount goes right under too.

Click on "Next" and a side bar should slide in. Review the values and hit "Submit" if they're correct.

Your transaction is submitted. You can get a look at it with the "View Tranasction" button

And that is all! Check ethereum address balance on Metamask.

### Swap from EVM-Compatible FRA to Native FRA Assets

The reverse is the case for moving FRA tokens from their EVM-compatible variant to the native one, and the screenshots show how it works
