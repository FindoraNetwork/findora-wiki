# View NFT (3 of 3)

This tutorial is Part 3 of 3 in the NFT Tutorial series, where we view our newly minted NFT. However, you can use the general tutorial for any ERC-721 token using MetaMask, including on Mainnet or any testnet. If you‚Äôd like to learn how to mint your own NFT on Findora, you should check out Part 1 of this NFT Tutorial series!

In Part 1, you should already have installed the MetaMask browser extension. However, to view your NFT you must use the mobile version of Metamask (since the browser extension version doesn't support viewing NFTs).


### Step 1: Install Metamask and Import Seed Phrase

First, go to your browser's Metamask extension and copy the 12 word `secret recovery phrase`. You can access the recovery phrase via Settings->Security & Privacy->Reveal Secret Recovery Phrase.

Next, download and install the [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metamask-blockchain-wallet/id1438144202) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.metamask&hl=en_US&gl=US) version of Metamask on your mobile.

Then, open Metamask on your mobile and select `Import from seed` and enter in the 12 seed words you copied down earlier. Set your password to finish the import process.

### Step 2: Set Metamask Network to [Anvil Testnet](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/network)

On Metamask mobile goto Settings->Networks->Add network. Then add in the network settings for [Findora Anvil Testnet](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/network).

At the top of Metamask, press the ‚ÄúWallet‚Äù button, after which you‚Äôll be prompted to select a network. As our NFT was minted on the Anvil Testnet, you‚Äôll want to select Anvil as your network.

### Step 3: Add Your NFT to MetaMask

First, find your NFT contract address and ERC-721 token ID (as discussed in Part 2 of the NFT tutorial).
