Within the Findora Wallet, you can perform a swap between `Native FRA` assets to `EVM-Compatible FRA` assets. `EVM-compatible FRA` tokens are best suited for dApp development and transactions on the Findora EVM. The Native and EVM-Compatible FRA tokens are swapped in a 1:1 ratio using a `burn-mint` function.

### Swap from Native FRA to EVM-Compatible FRA Assets

First step is to click on the Prism section of the sidebar. In the Native Wallet section then place the address of the wallet into the EVM-compatible wallet field. The amount goes right under too.

Click on "Next" and a side bar should slide in. Review the values and hit "Submit" if they're correct.

And that is all! Check ethereum address balance on Metamask.

The reverse is the case for moving FRA tokens from their EVM-compatible variant to the native one, and the screenshots show how it works
