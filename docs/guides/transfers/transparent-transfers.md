Step 3: In the next step, you should see a few input fields. 
    - The "From" input field designates the wallet you're transferring from. 
    - The "To" input field is where you enter the recipient's wallet address.
    - "Asset Type" refers to the asset that is being transferred
    - "Privacy Options" to choose whether to hide the asset type and amount.

Step 4: In the "To" input field, copy and paste the recipient's address and please make sure that you have this correct
> Tip: If you are moving assets among different wallets saved on your Findora wallet application, you can click on the "Wallet Address" drop down on the side, and it will be automatically filled with the corresponding wallet address

Step 5: Enter the amount you want to transfer

Step 6: Now we get to the more important part. To effectively do a transparent transfer, click on the "Show Amounts" to keep the amount transparent, and select "Show Asset Type" radio button to publicly show which asset you're transferring
